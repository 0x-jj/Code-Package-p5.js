Code-Package-p5.js
==================
Code package of the book [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de) for [p5.js](p5js.org/)

Setup
-----
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) (go for the latest stable version)
2. Open Terminal and `cd path/to/folder`
3. Run `npm install`

Running the sketches
--------------------
Start a local web server* (with live reload) by typing in your Terminal the command below. This will open the `index.html` file (list of all sketches) a new browser window. Done!

```
$ npm start
```

*Some sketches work only as expected when the files are placed online, as the rely on "security" sensitive functionality like loading external files. If you try to view them locally, you get some kind of "cross-origin" errors (see your browser's console). The solution is to serve the files using what's called a [local web server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).
